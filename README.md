# CMSI2021-Compound-Calc
Source code for homework 1 for CMSI 2021!

This project is a website formatted on both mobile and desktop that calculates compound interest.
There are 4 total inputs (3 text boxes and a dropdown). Each of these inputs have hover effects, and are flex elements encased in a grid. There is also an image of how RICH you'll be when you use my calculator! Lastly, aesthetic elements include 2 Google fonts, a footer that follows the screen, and an "Open Sandbox" button that doesnt go away! If this isn't the perfect calculator for you, I don't know what is.
